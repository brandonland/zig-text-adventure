# zig-text-adventure

### **This project is now archived**. It will be rebuilt with [raylib](https://github.com/ryupold/raylib.zig) in mind.
### I have decided it would be best to scrap the project, learn some raylib things, and have another go at it for a better 2nd pass.

A text adventure written in Zig for obvious reasons (I'm learning Zig, I'm new to low-level/systems programming languages in general, and I'm new to game development). I'm just looking to explore new territory.
The story content is not in place yet â€” I am focusing on architecture and game logic first. I am however writing a lot of notes for the story.

## Build
Dependencies:
- [Zig 0.11](https://ziglang.org/download/)

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into it

4. That's it :)
